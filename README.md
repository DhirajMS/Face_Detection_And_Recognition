A. Required Stuff for compilation

   1. OpenCV versioni used is 4.4.0 
      https://opencv.org/releases/

   2. Additional modules for opencv 
      https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib

   3. I have complied them for my laptop using cmake.
      https://github.com/DhirajMS/opencv-4.4.0

   4. visual studio 2019

   5. Don't forget to add opencv in "C:/opencv" folder and also in "\x64\Debug" also I'm not sure that the one compiled formy laptop will work onyours too.

B. About Face Detection and Recog Module

   Output : \x64\Debug

   1. As shown in screenshots and recordings when we launch program it will ask whether we want to Add faces or detect faces.

   2. Added faces will be stored in "Faces" folder

   3. To start over training an detecing delete all pictures in Faces folder and "eigenface.yml" file

   4. Faces must be added by face ids.
      (In sample me = 7 , My brother = 8, My father =9)


(Sorry for my poor laptop camera which led to less accuricy)

Thanks.
